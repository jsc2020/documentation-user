Review The Posts In Real-Time

Whenever a post is published, the product manager (and all the product followers)
get notified in their email inbox.

    By default, the user who created the product is automatically set as a follower.

To review the comment, you can find it in the *Chatter* of the product detail form *and* and in
the *Discuss* application.
