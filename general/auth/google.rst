Integrate Google Sign-In Authentication
=======================================

The **Google Sign-In Authentication** is a function that allows your users to sign in to Odoo 
with their Google account (the same account they already use with Gmail, etc). It reduces the burden 
of login for the users, and makes the process easier, quicker and more secure for them. Moreover, 
users do not need to remember or manage yet another password.
